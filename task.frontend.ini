1. div test7 and test8 to maintain the same width as 1 - 6 as a different group, regardless of the screen size
2. best way to handle imported libraries across different html pages (minimize load time, and need to reload)
3. create an interactive way to toggle the visability of 1 - 8 on/off, and adjust the display dynamically so there's no empty space regardless of the screen size
4. if you were to save the results of 3 in the database, how would you save it?
